<p>Story Discussion</p>
<p>My family and I recently took a road trip to Virginia. Roughly 14 hours in the car with my wife and 4 kids was fun and we only stopped 4 times for gas and/or food. We stayed at &quot;The Great Wolf Lodge&quot; for one night. This resort has an inside waterpark and an interactive role playing game called, MagicQuest, awesome! For the remainder of the trip we stayed at another hotel. We visited &quot;Ripley&rsquo;s Believe It or Not&quot; museum, the Yorktown battlefields and Colonial Williamsburg. We traveled about 17 hours to get back home, and seemed to stop about every 2-3 hours, that was a long day.</p>
